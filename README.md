# Project: Secure Authentication Using User Certificates

## Overview
This project implements a secure authentication protocol where a certificate is issued to each user during the sign-up process. The user then uses this certificate to authenticate themselves to the website, ensuring secure communication and verification.

## Problem Statement
In the current protocol, while no attacks were detected, the user and the website are not properly authenticating each other. This creates a potential security risk where a user may not be properly verified by the website.

## Solution
To solve this issue, we generate a unique certificate for each user during the sign-up process. This certificate is used by the user to authenticate themselves to the website. Although the website does not have its own certificate, the userâ€™s certificate allows the website to verify the legitimacy of the user. This enhances the security and trust between the user and the website.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VasudevGoud/Port_Scan.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Port_Scan
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the `portscan.py` script (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python portscan.py
   ```
2. Follow the authentication flow using the user-issued certificate.
3. Ensure secure communication is established between the user and the website.
